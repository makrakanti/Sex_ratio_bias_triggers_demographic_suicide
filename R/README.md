The provided datasets and scripts support the study titled "Sex ratio bias triggers demographic suicide in a dense tortoise population", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of Hermann’s tortoises. All relevant datasets and R-code are divided between folders: input (datasets), R (R-code), output (produced results such as model selection tables and model summaries), intermediates (produced datasets used for further analysis or graphs) and figures.
